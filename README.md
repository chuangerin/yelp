- Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
- Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
- Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
Filter page
- The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
- The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
- You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states
- Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
